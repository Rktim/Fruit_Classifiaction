## Introduction

In this project, we harness the power of deep learning to classify fruits. By leveraging two unique models, we aim to achieve high accuracy in fruit identification, showcasing the potential of neural networks in image classification tasks.

## Models Overview

We employ two powerful models for fruit classification:

1. **Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with PyTorch**: A tailor-made CNN designed to capture essential features of fruit images, implemented using PyTorch.

2. **Fine-Tuned VGG Network**: A pre-trained VGG model adapted to our dataset, providing a deeper architecture for enhanced performance.

‚å®Ô∏è## Dataset Details

### The dataset used in this project is organized into three main folders:

#### train: Contains training images
apple: Images of apples
banana: Images of bananas
mango: Images of mangoes

#### test: Contains testing images
apple: Images of apples for testing
banana: Images of bananas for testing
mango: Images of mangoes for testing
predict: Contains images for which predictions are to be made

## Results and Insights

ü§ñ### Model Performance
The models' performance metrics are presented below:


###  |Model     | Accuracy| 	Precision	Recall |F1-Score |
#### |Custom CNN	| 73.67% |	74.80% |  73.67% |	73.99% |
#### |VGG16	    | 87.00%   |  87.00% |	87.00% | 	87.00% |
